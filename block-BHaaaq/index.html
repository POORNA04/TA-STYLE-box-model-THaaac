                With RRR bagging its biggest honours at the Oscars, it’s no surprise that SS Rajamouli is turning heads in Hollywood with his larger-than-life movies, including Baahubali and Magadheera.
                Among those taking notice is Titanic and Avatar director James Cameron, who spoke to Rajamouli after RRR won the Best Foreign Language Film at the Critics’ Choice Awards earlier this year. “Because of all the work and passion you’ve put in… allthat must be yours. If you ever wanna make a movie over here (Hollywood), let’s talk,” Cameron told the RRR director.

                Now, with the Oscars’ win, Rajamouli’s stock has skyrocketed, positioning the filmmaker as a candidate to helm Hollywood projects.
                RRR’s lead actor Ram Charan, too, believes Rajamouli has the qualities to direct a Hollywood movie. “Rajamouli is a talented director and his fans want him to direct a big Hollywood film,” said Charan, adding that he hoped to see him direct a film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
